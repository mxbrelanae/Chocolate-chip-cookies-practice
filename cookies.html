        <h2>Breif History</h2>
        <p>Chocolate chips were created with the invention of chocolate chip cookies in 1937 when Ruth Graves Wakefield of the Toll House Inn in the town of Whitman, 
        Massachusetts added cut-up chunks of a semi-sweet Nestlé chocolate bar to a cookie recipe.  
        The cookies were a huge success, and Wakefield reached an agreement in 1939 with Nestlé to add her recipe to the chocolate bar's packaging in exchange for a lifetime supply of chocolate. 
        Initially, Nestlé included a small chopping tool with the chocolate bars. In 1941, Nestlé and at least one of its competitors started selling the chocolate in "chip" (or "morsel") form. 
        My Grandma ever so slightly changed this recipe by adding more vanilla with the addition of white chocolate chips along with the standard milk chocolate chips which makes this recipe just <em>THAT</em> much better!</p>
